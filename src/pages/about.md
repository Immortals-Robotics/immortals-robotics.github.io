# The Immortals SSL Team

The Immortals Small Size League team was founded in 2008. We first participated in RoboCup 2009 in Graz, Austria. Since then, we've grown to become one of the most competitive teams in the RoboCup SSL league.

## Our History

Starting with a small group of passionate engineers, we built our first generation of robots in 2008. After months of hard work and dedication, we were ready for our international debut at RoboCup 2009 in Graz, Austria.

Our continuous improvement led to our first major achievement: 2nd place in RoboCup 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. This was a pivotal moment for our team, establishing us as serious contenders in the Small Size League.

Most recently, we secured 3rd place in RoboCup 2023 in Bordeaux, France, demonstrating our consistent performance and technical innovation.

## Our Technology

The Immortals robots feature:

- High-precision omnidirectional movement systems
- Advanced vision processing algorithms
- Real-time strategic decision making

## Small Size League (SSL)

The RoboCup Small Size League is a robotics competition where teams of fully autonomous robots play soccer against each other. Each team can field up to 11 robots, each fitting within an 18cm diameter circle and not exceeding 15cm in height.

The game is played on a green carpeted field, and the robots must be fully autonomous, making their own decisions based on information from cameras mounted above the field.
